# New-York-Crime-Data-Analysis
Conducting exploratory data analysis of new york crimes committed borough wise.
The dataset used has been extracted from the NYC open data website.
First I cleaned the data and then performed the analysis using visualization techniques with matplotlib and stats with numpy and pandas.
Bar graphs, box plots, pair plots, heatmaps, scatter plots, histograms and more were used to display observations like:
- the co relation between two columns/values
- which borough has the most number of crimes
- types of offences committed gender based
